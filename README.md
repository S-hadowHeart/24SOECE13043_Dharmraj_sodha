# 💻 C# Learning Repo (a.k.a. "My Teacher Made Me Do It"™)

> _"Because sometimes, you're just trying to pass the class and suddenly you have a public repo."_ 😅

## 🎓 What is this?

Welcome to the magical land of beginner C# code — forged in the fires of **university assignments** and **deadlines I didn't sign up for**.  
This repository exists **solely because my teacher said so**. Otherwise, I’d be happily coding away in my own project cave, far from public judgment.

## 📚 What will you find here?

- 🧠 Code written while half-asleep in lectures  
- 📦 Console apps that might or might not run  
- 🐛 Bugs that could be considered "features" (if you're optimistic)  
- 💡 The glorious evolution of confusion into slightly less confusion  

## 🙈 Why is this public?

Because **_I had no choice_**.  
Somehow making a repo public was a requirement — not sure how that helps me learn C#, but hey, here we are.

## ⚠️ Warning

Please lower your expectations.  
This is **not** a showcase of my finest code. It’s more like:  
> “Look, I did the homework. Please pass me.”

If you're here looking for inspiration, *I gently redirect you elsewhere.* 🏃‍♂️💨

## 🚀 One Day...

I’ll look back on this and laugh.  
For now, I’m just trying to compile without tears.
